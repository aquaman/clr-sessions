TEST NOTES
-----------------------------------------------

Created a new "decision" that I already knew the answer to: What kind of food to have for dinner?  I wanted to see if DecideRight could reach the same conclusion.

Options:
  * American
  * Chinese
  * Mexican
  * Italian
  * Pizza
  * Nothing

Criteria:
  * price
  * taste
  * convenience
  * last had
  * health	

Report notes:

FOOD.RTF

  "Nothing" appears to be the best choice even though my answer was "Pizza."  

  ??? How did it reach this calculation?  I would like to devote a session to this.	
  ??? what's the difference between N/A and ??? values
  (see BUG 1 below)

FOOD2.RTF 

  * DecideRight showed my 6 choices (options) in order of importance but does not describe why it ranked them (see BUG below)
  * DecideRight did show my criteria ranked in order, however

FOOD3.RTF

  Created this file because I had a test idea: add some new criteria options to an existing decision table and re-run the report.

	Result: PASS -- changes get reflected and recalc'ed

	Found a problem in the formatting, though (see BUG 3)

  Test Idea: does eliminating unknown values remove the disclaimer at the top of the report: ("Warning!  Some elements in the decision table which generated this report are labeled "To Be Rated" or "Unknown," and it may therefore be premature to draw conclusions from the data.")  

	Result: PASS -- the disclaimer was removed.


OPPORTUNITY: Noticed that pushpin icon on toolbar for decision table does nothing when no option is highlighted. (see BUG 4 below)	

Session interrupted by phone call.  Will pick this up in other session tomorrow.

Conclusions: I'd like another session or two to learn the algorithm DecideRight uses to make decisions.  Then I can verify that the report is accurate.


BUGS
-----------------------------------------------
#BUG 1
Not dragging the weight slider for a criteria item leads to an ??? instead of max "Poor"

Repro:
1 -- launch QuickBuild to create a new decision
2 -- put in some options | Next
3 -- put in some criteria | Next
4 -- when weighing the criteria move on to the Rate Options portion
5 -- don't move the slider for one of the options
6 -- run the report

Result:  Graph shows that value as being ??? instead of "Poor".   Since the default position of the rating slider is at the end of the Poor scale, I assumed it would be logged as a maximum "Poor" value, not "unknown".

#BUG 2
Report is missing descriptor for Option section

Repro:
1 -- create a decision using QuickBuild
2 -- File | Generate Report

Result:  The preamble to the list of ranked choices is missed a descriptor that tells in which order they were ranked.  In the criteria section of the report, it tells the order: ("The criteria used to evaluate the options were (in order of importance))."

#BUG 3
Graph labels (y-axis) are cut of if they are longer than 20 characters

Repro:
1 -- create a decision with options that are over 20 characters
2 -- run through QuickBuild with all the defaults
3 -- File | Generate Report

Result: The y-axis labels are truncated.

#BUG 4 OPPORTUNITY
Pushpin toolbar button ("View/edit explanatory text for a decision element") doesn othing if no option is selected in the decision table

Repro:
1 -- launch a decision table
2 -- click the pushpin icon

Result: No response.

Expected:  Would be helpful if a dialog that tells me I have to select an option first.

ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------
#ISSUE 1
I'd like another session or two to learn the algorithm DecideRight uses to make decisions.  Then I can verify that the report is accurate.

#ISSUE 2
What's the difference between N/A and ??? values ?
