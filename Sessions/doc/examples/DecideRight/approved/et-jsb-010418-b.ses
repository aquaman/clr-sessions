TEST NOTES
-----------------------------------------------
Launched DR and went right into QuickBuild to make a decision on whether to build or acquire an R&D lab. Followed the flow of my thinking, doing one thing after another, pausing only to note bugs and start the flow over.

  * Listed criteria and options (found BUG 1 below)

  * Looked at main table window (BUG 2 below)

  * Proceeded through QB, clicking defaults until generate report and noticed the options listed in the main table window are also cut off  (BUG 3 below)

  * Clicked Main table toolbar button, Weights button, paper clip toolbar button ("view/edit documents that expain a decision element"), pushpin icon  (see BUG 4 below)

  * Started with File / New to create new table -- clicked No when prompted to "Do a QuickBuild on the new table" I wanted to see how to add an option and criterion, but it's not clear what to do to add another (see BUG 5 below)

At this point, I noticed I had 10 open decisions.  This should be a stress test for a later session.  Closed them all and started fresh flow.

  * Started new decision table, 4 options, 4 crtieria, rated Excellent to Poor
walked through each menu, selected the contents, looking for confusing flow:

File / New / add options / add criteria / help / save / close
File / New / add options / add criteria / help / save / print / close
File / Open / add options / add criteria / help / save / close
File / Open / add options / add criteria / help / save / print / close
Table / Weights / Ratings / Report / Graph / Advisor / Table
all toolbar buttons: Save / cut / copy / paste / up option / down option / left criterion/ right criterion / view edit docs / sensitivity

Most of this session was bug investigation and reporting.

BUGS
-----------------------------------------------
#BUG 1
Rate options dialog only holds 37 characters for "rate the option" and "on the criterion"

600X800 resolution

Repro:
1 -- QB
2 -- list options and criteria that exceed 37 characters
3 -- proceed to the "rate options" dialog
Result:
Notice that the text in the captions for "rate the option" and "on the criterion" is cut off after 37 characters

#BUG 2
Option text is cut off after 35 characters  in window next to main table window

600X800 resolution

Repro:
1 -- QB
2 -- list options and criteria that exceed 25 characters
3 -- proceed to the "rate options" dialog
4 -- look up to the Overlap control window to the right of the main table
Result: 
Text is cut off after 25 characters

#BUG 3
Option text on right side of main table window is cut off after 35 characters

600X800 resolution
Repro:
1 -- QB
2 -- list options and criteria that exceed 25 characters
3 -- proceed to the "rate options" dialog
4 -- look up to the Options (Y axis) window to the left of the main table
Result: 
Text is cut off after 35 characters.

#BUG 4
Paper clip, pushpin, arrow toolbar buttons are not functional on Weights window
Repro:
1 -- after a decision is made, click the Table button on the toolbar
2 -- click the Weights button
3 -- click the paper clip / pushpin / or arrow buttons
Result:
Nothing happens.

#BUG 5
Not intuitive how to add a second option or crtierion when not using QB
Repro:
1 -- File menu / New
2 -- click No to the prompt to using QB
3 -- click the "Click to Add Option" button on the right side of the table
4 -- type a new option in the "Type New Option Here" field
5 -- ENTER
6 -- click the option you just made
Result:
How does the user create a second option?  There is nothing in the manual about this. The same is true for adding criterion

#BUG 6
Text field is unresponsive, so should be grayed out
Repro:
1 -- FIle menu / New
2 -- click No to the prompt to using QB
3 -- click the question marked cell in the table
4 -- click the text field to the right of the toolbar
Result:
Although the cursor blinks in this field, nothing can be typed.  It is not meant for user input, so it should be grayed.

ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------
#ISSUE 1
Need to test at different screen resolutions.

#ISSUE 2
Stress test idea: How many open decisions can you have?
