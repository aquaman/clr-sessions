BUGS
-----------------------------------------------
#N/A

ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------
#ISSUE
Manual mentions different platforms (Win 3.1, WFW, and WinNT 3.51) and does not mention Win2000. We think Win 2000 is important to test on and that the older OSes are no longer meaningful. 

#ISSUE
We did this analysis on Win98.  I have no data to suggest that features may be different on other operating systems, but I'm not sure about that.
