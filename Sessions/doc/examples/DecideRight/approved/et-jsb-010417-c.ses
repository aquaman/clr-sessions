TEST NOTES
-----------------------------------------------
Stepped through the steps in the manual, starting on page 5-1 to walk through a new decision table -- ended on page 5-6

  * Clicked toolbar buttons (see BUG 1)
  * added options and criteria w / weighting (see BUG 8)
  * added options that were non-alphenumeric characters
  * tested Optional Overview field -- 32000 characters entered
  * Edit menu: Add Option (see BUG 2) (via menu and clicking.  Tested how many options you can list and alphabetizing (see BUG 3 and 7)
??? Manual says that I can return to the table by "clicking any other table element."  Not sure what this means.
  * Entered a description for an option 
  * Changed the name of an existing option
  * Added a new option (see BUG 4 and 5)
  * Verified a option can be deleted with right-click menu or edit menu
??? Should Undo work after deleting an option?  It doesn't. (see ISSUE 2)
  * Added 63 columns of criteria -- (see BUG 6 & ISSUE 1)

OPPORTUNITY: tested Find/Replace on option description (DCR about no Replace button -- UI shows a confirm instead) -- spent about 10 minutes testing the max length of the description field

After creating a table using the steps in the manual, I didn't see any important differences from using QuickBuild.

BUGS
-----------------------------------------------
#BUG 1
UI: paper clip and pushpin buttons are not disabled, even though they do nothing

Repro:
1 -- create a new decision manually
2 -- click either paper clip or pushpin button (fly out text says "view/edit documents that explain a decision element"

Result: No response.

Expected: Should be grayed out, else to perform the function that the flyout menu claims should be performed.

Repro:
The following menu items do not have underbars:
	File | Preferences

#BUG 3 
Decision table lets you have options and criteria that are identically named

Repro:
1 -- Make a decision table manually
2 -- add two criteria and options with the same name

Result: no warning that there is a duplicate
Expected: No duplicates to be allowed, because of potential confusion to user

#BUG 4 
When focus is on Option list in table, there is no arrow key support to scroll through list

Repro:
1 -- make a new decision table
2 -- highlight an option
3 -- press the up or down arrows

Result: No response.
Expected: Arrow keys should be active to scroll through the list of options.


#BUG 5
Data can't be entered in entry box for new option when focus is on table

Repro:
1 -- In the option view, click on the table
2 -- click on the insertion point
3 -- type something

Result: There is an insertion-point cursor, but keyboard is unresponsive. 

#BUG 6 
Crash -- GPF in DECIDER.EXE (crash in GDI.EXE in module 00016:000007f1 when entering over 60 columns of criteria

Repro:
1 -- create a new decision table (manually)
2 -- add criteria by typing in a name and hitting ENTER
3 -- repeat approx. 60 columns

Result: GPF in GDI.EXE.  When you try to launch DecideRight again, dialog pops up -- "not enough free memory" even though there is no other app open.

#BUG 7
New option added to existing options does not get sorted alphabetically

Repro:
1 -- create a new decision table
2 -- add 5 or 6 options
3 -- add some criteria
4 -- go back and add another option

Result: The new additional option does not get alphabetically sorted like the others until the table is closed and re-opened.

#BUG 8
Identical options can be entered


ISSUES
-----------------------------------------------
#ISSUE 1
Is there a recommended maximum number of criteria?  We were getting GPFs with about 60 columns.

#ISSUE 2
Should Undo work after deleting an option?  It doesn't.
