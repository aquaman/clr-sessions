TEST NOTES
-----------------------------------------------
Entered 20,000 characters in options then criteria section of QuickBuild. (see BUG 1 below)  -- clicked all UI buttons while it appears to be calculating rows and columns -- every few seconds DR would come back and allow a mouse click to be processed, then returns to its calculations

Clicked toolbar buttons after opening DR (see BUG 2 below)

list options 1 -10, w/ criteria (see BUG 3 below)

list options 1- 100, w/ criteria (see BUG 4 below)

DR crashed, when relaunched, error msg from Windows: not enoguh memory.  The only other thing open was notepad!  Suspect a memory leak.

When to save notepad file (test input data of numbers) and the save as dialog, went blank when toggling to another notepad, could not recover -- had to shut down!

Did a 50 X 50 table and it did not crash (stress.drd)
Printed the report (see BUG 5)

Did a 75 X 75 table (stress75.drd)
(see BUG 6)

Most of this session was spent investigating and reproing the crashes.

BUGS
-----------------------------------------------
#BUG 1
No hourglass with long names
1 -- QB
2 -- Enter 20000 characters in options
3 -- Enter 20000 characters in criteria
4 -- Next on "weight criteria" window
Result:
No hourglass while it calculates table, app is unresponsive

#BUG 2
Buttons should be grayed if not active
1 -- launch DR and do a QB
2 -- close all QB and DR windows
3 -- click the buttons on the toolbar
Result:
They can be clicked, but nothing happens.

#BUG 3
Options are listed by ordinal, not numeric
1 -- launch QB
2 -- in options list, list the numbers 1- 10 (a number on each line)
3 -- do the same for criteria
4 -- finish
Result:
The numbers for options are listed by ordinal not numeric, so they are listed 1, 10, 11, 12 ...

#BUG 4 
GPF when doing 100 X 100 options X criteria
1 -- QB
2 -- list the numbers 1- 100, a carriage return after each number for options
3 -- do the same for criteria
4 -- finish
Result: After 30 seconds of the table populating, DR crashes with a GPF in decider.exe in module 0016:0000082f

#BUG 5
Only 8 colors in report legend, which are re-used
Repro:
1 -- make a table with 10 options and 10 criteria
2 -- weight each and print a report
Result: 
Notice that in the "Comaprisons Among Choices" graph the legend colors are reused since there are more than 8

GPF in decider.exe after creating 75X75 table
Repro:
1 -- QB
2 -- Options 1 - 75 (numbers only)
3 -- Criteria 1 - 75

Result:
While populating the table, an error message: "Warning: Runtime error: the parameter is incorrect (OS error 16r57) (see error.log for more information) -- clicked OK, then got a 32-bit GPF in decider module VVM31W.DLL at 017f:1003804f"  clicked Ok to dismiss the error and *exevy open app* gets dismissed.
