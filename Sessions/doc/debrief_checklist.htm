<h1>Session Debrief Checklist</h1>

<h2>Charter</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Did you review relevant approved session reports?</li>
  <li>Does it match the bulk of the testing that was actually done?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Areas</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Is there at least one O/S keyword (unless it's not applicable)?</li>
  <li>Is the build keyword accurate?</li>
  <li>Is there at least one strategy keyword?</li>
  <li>Is there at least one product area, as specific as meaningful to specify?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Duration</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Is the duration code in line with the actual duration?</li>
  <li>Was the session continuous and uninterrupted?</li>
</ul>

<h2>TBS</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Have the TBS definitions been followed?</li>
  <li>Have the TBS precedence rules been followed?</li>
  <li>Do the TBS numbers relate to On Charter work only?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>If the opportunity number is over 0%, what was the opportunity?</li>
  <li>If the opportunity number is over 25%, consider modifying the charter.</li>
  <li>If the opportunity number is over 50%, modify the charter for this session 
  and consider doing a new session based on the original charter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Files</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>If there were no data files, why not?</li>
  <li>If there were data files, were they original or re-used? If re-used, were 
  they modified in any way? If so, how do they now relate to other sessions that 
  refer to the same data?</li>
  <li>Is there an associated test coverage outline that should be referenced?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test Notes</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Are they comprehensible?</li>
  <li>In conjunction with the charter, do they answer the question &quot;what happened 
  in this test session?&quot;</li>
  <li>Do they include information about coverage, oracles, and strategy?</li>
  <li>Is there anything in the notes that can be re-used in a future session? If 
  not, that may be okay, but remember: part of the reason for the notes is to 
  build a better plan for testing.</li>
  <li>Is this section free of issues and bugs?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Is enough information included to reproduce the problem?</li>
  <li>Is the section free of test notes and issues?
</ul>

<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>If there are no issues, does that mean there was no confusion, no remaining questions, 
and no obstacles in the path of testing?</li>
  <li>Do any issues require actions to be taken?</li>
  <li>Is the section free of test notes and bug reports?
</ul>

<h2>Overall</h2>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Will metrics based on this session sheet faithfully represent the testing that 
was done?</li>
  <li>Do the results of this session suggest the need for another session?</li>
  <li>Should this session be extended and amended?
</ul>
