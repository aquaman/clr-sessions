CLR-SESSIONS: Command-Line Ruby Session-Based Testing Framework
===============================================================

This is a text file-based database for creating and managing Exploratory Testing session files. To understand the context for this framework, search for information on Session-Based Test Management or SBTM. If you don't know where to start, this page has some helpful info and links: http://staqs.com

This framework was a port from the original Perl scripts to Ruby, and then extended with additional bug fixes and features.

Currently, this framework only supports Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7 and 1.9.2. Work will be underway soon to resurrect and complete this tool. Additional helpers are welcome.

Please read the INSTALL.txt and work through the examples in the "docs" folder. Please leave me feedback or add Issues to this repo to help me prioritise fixes in the coming weeks.

Happy Testing.

Cheers!
